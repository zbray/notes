# HTML

## Links

Anchor Elements are defined by wrapping an element with an <a> tag - this element becomes a link.

Anchor tags require information including targets that will send the user to the linked location. An HTML attribute (name, value)gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element's opening tag. Anchor tags require an href attribute to provide the target to the element.

Anchor tags can link to any kind of target on the internet - videos, pdf files, images, etc.

Default behavior in most browsers is to open links in the same tab, this can be changed by adding the <code>target</code> attribute
