## Tips

- Keep git commits atomic

- package.log tells anyone with access to the code what npm packages are needed

### Comments

Comments are lines of text that we write when we want to leave notes for ourselves and other developers. This is a great way to help other developers understand your code better by annotating bits of code,  breaking out files into sections, or adding meta information to code files. This text has no effect on the output of your code because, when placed in the right syntax, the coding language you're writing in will know to ignore it.
