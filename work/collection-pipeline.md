- What is grep?

Grep is a command that can search for matching patterns in a file. Grep is short for "global regular expression print"

The core behaivor of grep uses the syntax `grep PATTERNS FILE` with the ability to insert an OPTION before PATTERNS

`OPTION` can be many things including `-i` which will ignore case, `-w` which will find the exact word or `-c` which will count the number of occurrences of the pattern input

`PATTERNS` will be the search terms

`FILE` will be the file being queried
